To ensure a working setup for your development environment, please follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary packages by executing either `npm install` or `yarn install` in your terminal. This command will install all dependencies listed in your project's `package.json` file.

2. To initiate the development server, run `npm run dev`. This command will start a local development server.

3. Access your application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. This URL will direct you to the homepage of your application, where you can view the current state of your project.
